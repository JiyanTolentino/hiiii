                  <h3><p>So this is it,</p></h3>
                  <p>I like you. I definitely like you—it's not just about your presence, I mean THESE; the soft voice you have (kahit di marinig), the serious look on your face (literall), the way you engage and socialize with people, the weirdness that you hesitate to show in public—probably, and lastly the way you think //one of your attractive side to be honest HAHAHAHAHA kaya nga na-fall ako, I'm attracted to weird and lowkey ahhh people.</p>
                  
                  <p>I also apologize for liking you, it was accidental and I never intended to because of what you said to me one time na "I felt betrayed if you, my bff, actually have fallen for me." You are just so very attractive—not just the outside ships kase ammo mon, but the weirdnes, mixed personality that you possess and the deepest part of you. I was, and I am still interested in you, I want to know more about you. I lowkey want to be something that can be part of both your heart and mind. All the unspoken thoughts and emotions I carried when I first began speaking to you have, at last, finally been said, written, and typed na ginawang site.</p>
                  
                  <p>As for the reasoning behind all of this—well, I am a programmer, remember? I once said I longed to create something truly unique… and this is it—a site made for my confession HAHAHAHAHAHH. I just wanted to be uniq, so that I can be the only one that do these kind of things.  Originally, my intention was to put everything into a letter—a longggggg assssss written letter, but then you said that ano, may gumawa na non sayo kaya ayon, meron na akong naisip na ibang paraan HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</p>
                  
                  <p>So yes, every word I spoke was true—I'm seryos asf w/ u, no other words can describe it. I want to show you "me", I want to pursue you for realll, and I am prepared to embrace every risk, even if it means both of us may wound each other. Still, I ask—allow me the honor of courting you, even if it take years as I know that you are not allowed to have a funny thing called ano Gayyem until you have gotten a work.</p>
                  
                  <p>I will wait po kaya deretsahin mo ako pag ayaw mo talaga sakin ehe</p>
                  
                  <p>"D uray masaktan kanto metlang ud-udi?", wen urayek.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Haan ko pela gamin kaya agi risk, baka nu masaktan nak metla ud-udi", kaya ka nga urayen ingga na nga kayamon, I will always reassure you that I won't do the same mistake and bomb decisions that your past headaches had made.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Baka sao-saom la dagita—baka un-una nalang." haan, I can show you that you're wrong, actions with words are unstoppable.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Bengeg nak" ana't pakek ita.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Narigat nak i handle" ikarigatak nga i handle ka</p>
                  
                  <p>"Dinak maawatan" HAHAHAHAAHAH awaten ka a ana kuma.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Sure ka kenyakon?" sigurado ssob.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Haan nak ibat-bati" maibati ka garud nu aginnuray ta? HAHAHAHAH</p>
                  
                  <p>"Agpapada kayo" HAHAHAHAHAH NO</p>
                  
                  <p>"Aguray ka d uray haan a sigurado?", yes, I'll wait</p>
                  
                  <p>"Baka masaktan ka" hindi HAHAHAHAH I can take all the pain in order to reach you, just don't bugaw-bugaw me with words nga nasa-sakit, I'm just too soft pagdating sa mga words na nakakasakit 😓</p>

                  <p>"Baka maistorbo ka" IDC if it's you, you never bothered me, baka syak pay ketdi maka istorbo knyam</p>
‎
‎                  
                  <p>"kasta met ibagbaga da HAHAHAAH" do you think I'm them? pati dagita us-usarek nga words of anon ket man-mantsaan da—but I'll change it, kayat konagbalin nga uniq.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                  <p>"Ado da pay dita, makasarak ka mt sabali", ehhhh so what?? Are they "you"? No, not at all. Therefore, I would rather be a Priest if it's not you.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                  <p>Let's not overthink the future too much and focus on building what we are and what we have right now, the present, wag mo po sana pangunahan :((( I believe in what we have right now, and I’m willing to put in the effort to make it grow. </p>
                  
                  <p>I know that you are afraid, afraid of loving someone again, and scared that you might get hurt again. You continue to push me away, yet I find myself unable to do it—for I know, with no freaking doubts, that the feelings I hold are sincere. So please, I'm asking you to give me a chance to prove everything and show you that all my intentions are pure no matter how many times you say it's not.</p>
                  
                  <p>I won't ever force your feelings, just take your time. No matter what your answer may be, I will always carry a smile upon my face, thankful for the chance to feel this deeply again. The only thing is that, I want to show you that I am willing to wait whatever your decision might be, just let me, let me stay by your side until then.</p>
                  
                  <p>As I always say, I can't make promises, but this time I will—I promise you that I am not gonna let you go and I won't leave you in the air as you always expect. Haan ko nga mai-kari nga dika masaktan, ngem mai-karik kenyam nga kaya'k a plastaren iti pagkamalyak tapno diko'n to ulit maaramiden.</p>
                  
                  <p>So once again, let me, even just a little. Pahintulutan mo akong kumatok sa iyong puso, hoping that I can get in, makiki-sawsaw sa iyong buhay, di-uray sangka-bassit man lang ba HAHAHAHAHAH. Maaari mo ba akong bigyan ng awtoridad upang puksain ang iyong mga pangamba at pag-aalala?</p>
                  
                  <p>You are the risk that I am willing to take. There are times when a phrase suddenly comes to mind, saying—"If I can't take the risk, then I am not worthy of your tinatagong side" HAHAHAHAHAH THAT'S WHYYYY. At that specific night, when I was cornered by your question's—I was forced to say that I like you ://// I was planning not too (yet), because I was afraid of what will the consequences be—however it was not as I expected HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AND I AM THANKFUL FOR THAT.</p>

                  <p>It was last December when I fell for you unknowingly—probably the first week or the second week? I thought it would just be a simple, happy crush, but it wasn’t. As days went by, I found myself admiring you, looking at you from a distance, even talking to you even if it only lasted about 3-5 minutes, ehe. The way you talk—again, it’s so soft, too soft that I can't even hear it, agis-isem nak latta nukan. Your weird and mysterious personality, and lastly, you are just very interesting aglalo ta mindset mo, I never thought that in this, our batch, have this kind of thinking.</p>>

                  <p>Well, I didn’t want to ruin our friendship, so I decided not to confess and just suppressed these feelings, hoping they would vanish—just like what I’m supposed to be doing, since I also have an avoidant attachment style. However, as time passed, they didn’t. Unfortunately, I’m still head over heels for you, LOL.</p>

                  <p>Was it January when we had that ridiculous thing called "Distancing"? HAHAHAHAH! I’m accountable for that. It was for the best—I protected what had to be protected, and that was you. I knew that those guys shipping us might overwhelm you and make you uncomfortable, so I decided to distance myself. BUTTT, because of that—I don’t know if it lasted about a month or two—where we didn’t talk personally or online, it felt like standing in the same room but living in different worlds. And then it hit me: YES, I’M FREAKING IN LOVE WITH HER. I was sure na. No more doubts, no more running—just this terrifying, kind of feeling.</p>

                  <p>And then, I started using my forbidden technique called the "Penge notes technique" just to, ummm, break the thing I built—the "Distancing" shit, HAHAHAHAH. Pathetic? Maybe. Effective? Absolutely. You cornered me one night; I wasn’t ready to tell you any of it. That’s why I said, "I wasn’t sure about my feelings." But I was pretty sure about them. The things I said—"agdwadwa nak"—it was just a way for me to actually find out if you were still in love with A. But thankfully, you answered my not-so-question shit. And just like that, hope flickered back to life.</p>
                  
                  <p>You are worth every fear I must proudly conquer and every challenges I must endure. I am prepared to risk everything in order to pursuit you, no matter how dangerous each step I take along a path filled with uncertainty.</p>

                <p>I’ve totally fallen for you. You give me this weird feeling every time I see your name in my notifications, every time you message me, look at me, or even talk to me. Is this what they call butterflies? I don’t know… maybe? I looked it up, and it perfectly describes how I feel. I am sorry, I really do need to apologize, for me, for you, that I liked you. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I get anxious everytime I wonder if I'm treating you right the way you deserve this time? Are you not annoyed with me? Is there something I’m doing that hurts you? That’s why I’m so cautious. If I ever misstep, please tell me.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I really like you, to the point that I am willing to wait for hours, days, months, and even years for you. I stay up all night just so I could talk to you about some weird shts. Even you, telling me how your day went, it excites me if it's about you. I want you to yap at me everytime, I want to listen you all day long. I care about you.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I will give you everything that I could offer you without hesitations in ny head. No pressure—take it only if you want to.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I want to show you that not everyone leaves, through ups and downs, I would stay. I’ll show you my best and my flaws, because I want you to know the real me.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I won't leave. I won't give up—everything I feel is sincere and genuine without any doubts. Push me away, and I would still be there. I mean yes, there are hundreds, thousands, or even millions of reasons to leave—however, you are the very reason I would stay. But I'll always respect your space too.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I always try my best to be better for you. I am not "them", I am me. </p>
                  
                  <p>I want to learn more about you—to understand the depths of your thoughts, feelings, and the back stories that shape you the way you are right now. I long to stand and stay beside you when you need someone to be there for you and scream all of your problems, if you can't scream then just say it like you normally do—I will always be all ears. I really do want to witness you show all your emotions Let me be that annoying "ngilaw" in your freaking peaceful life that chooses you again-and-again to annoy you (it's not about ngilaw HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH NAM).</p>
                
                   <p>You deserve more, and that is why I am shaping myself into the person worthy of you—one who can meet your expectations and offer you the respect and love you are worthy of.</p>
                 
                    <p>I guess we really don’t know what tomorrow holds, but today? I choose you. Not out of habit, not out of loneliness—but because everytime I imagine something special, your in it. So yeah, I am scared of fcking up everything, scared of being not enough—but the most scariest sht that I am afraid of is that never telling you that you're that kind of a human being that I want to risk.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>I won’t lie—this scares me too. I am terrified of what will the consequences might be. Not the rejection, but the possibility of you leaving w/o any trace. I’m terrified of this, but I’m more terrified of never trying. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>We might hurt each other, misunderstand things, or even fight. But I hope that we could solve and walk through all of this willingly instead of going to sleep with a heavy heart in both of our hearts.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Wag mong aksayahin ang panahon mo matapatan mo lang ang aking enerhiya, do what you want to do, I understand. We have different lives anyway. You don't even need to respond to this. Just letting you know that you are safe with me. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Kitam tuy inaramid mo kenyak ಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ, kasla nak la  bagtit nga umis-isem memesa balay, tas naka sango CP—I am not complaining abt that, I'm very happy with it. Kyaaa yessss.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Look, I ain't good with fancy words, but here's the truth—I'm very ummmm, you describe it. D uray adda ta man iti bubong, wenno groundfloor, I'll be that tanga-tanga ass who won't leave nor  complain about things. Most things in life come with expiration dates, but this? Kakaiba to, pang matagalan HAHAHAHA</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>You are more than enough. No matter what happens, I’ll always cherish what we have.</p>

                    <p> I do not pressure you in any way, just take how much time it'll take for you to completely understand your own feelings. Just, whatever it will be or how long it might take, as long as you are honest with your self, it's worth it. I do not need to fight with your mind if your heart already supports me. SOOOOOO DON"T PRESSURE URSELF AHHH. </p>

                    <p> I am not asking too much, okay? I'm contented what you already giving me. I live our small talks di uray awan ma topic HAHAHAH I will always find a way just to spend my time with you. Umanay etoyen, ios nayan. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Thank you for letting me feel this way—it’s terrifying and beautiful all at once. I mean every word I said.</p>
                 
                    <p>Ginuhugma tika Frinsezzzzz HAHAHAHAHAHAH I yearn for you, push me away, I'll comeback—I just don't care anymore. Ano ang masasabi mo? Pwede po ba akong maging parte ng iyong bohai? Kung ayaw mo mag asawa, edi wag, pake ko—bigyan mo lang ako ng pagkakataon na maging istorbo sa bohai mo oki na.</p>

                    <p> You do not need to respond to any of this, just let me know if you already read it. I hope you like it HAHAHAHA. </p>
