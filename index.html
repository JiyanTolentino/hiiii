                  <h3><p>So this is it,</p></h3>
                  <p>I like you. I definitely like youâ€”it's not just about your presence, I mean all; the soft voice you have (kahit di marinig), the serious look on your face (literall), the way you engage and socialize with people, and lastly the weirdness that you hesitate to show in publicâ€”probably one of your attractive side to be honest HAHAHAHAHA kaya nga na-fall ako, I'm attracted to weird and lowkey ahhh people, and it makes me want to protect and ano you yung parang ano ba.</p>
                  
                  <p>I also apologize for liking you, it was accidental and I never planned to because of what you said to me one time na "I felt betrayed if you, my bff, actually have fallen for me." You are just so very attractiveâ€”not just the outside ships kase ammo mon, but the weirdness and mixed personality that you possess. I was, and I am still interested in you, I want to know more about you. I'm purposely want to be something that can be part of both your heart and mind. All the unspoken thoughts and emotions I carried when I first began speaking to you have, at last, finally been said, written, and typed na ginawang site.</p>
                  
                  <p>As for the reasoning behind all of thisâ€”well, I am a programmer, remember? I once said I longed to create something truly uniqueâ€¦ and this is itâ€”a site made for my confession HAHAHAHAHAHH. No other guy did this to you right? Originally, my intention was to put everything into a letterâ€”a longggggg assssss written letter, but then you said that ano, may gumawa na non sayo kaya ayon, meron na akong naisip na ibang paraan HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH.</p>
                  
                  <p>So yes, every word I spoke was trueâ€”I'm seryos asf w/ u, no other words can describe it. I want to commit even if you wont do the same, I want to pursue you for realll, and I am prepared to embrace every risk, even if it means both of us may wound each other. Still, I askâ€”allow me the honor of courting you, even if it take years as I know that you are not allowed to have a funny thing called ano Gayyem until you have a work.</p>
                  
                  <p>I will wait.</p>
                  
                  <p>"D uray masaktan kanto metlang ud-udi?", wen urayek.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Haan ko pela gamin kaya agi risk, baka nu masaktan nak metla ud-udi", kaya ka nga urayen ingga na nga kayamon, I will always reassure you that I won't do the same mistake and bomb decisions that your past headaches had made.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Baka sao-saom la dagitaâ€”baka un-una nalang." haan, I can show you that you're wrong, actions with words are unstoppable.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Bengeg nak" ana't pakek ita.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Narigat nak i handle" ikarigatak nga i handle ka</p>
                  
                  <p>"Dinak maawatan" HAHAHAHAAHAH awaten ka a ana kuma.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Sure ka kenyakon?" sigurado ssob.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Haan nak ibat-bati" maibati ka garud nu aginnuray ta? HAHAHAHAH</p>
                  
                  <p>"Agpapada kayo" HAHAHAHAHAH NO</p>
                  
                  <p>"Aguray ka d uray haan a sigurado?", yes, I'll wait</p>
                  
                  <p>"Baka masaktan ka" hindi HAHAHAHAH I can take all the pain in order to reach you, just don't bugaw-bugaw me with words nga nasa-sakit, I'm a really soft guy pagdating sa mga words na nakakasakit ðŸ˜“</p>
                  
                  <p>I know that you are afraid, afraid of loving someone again, and scared that you might get hurt again. You continue to push me away, yet I find myself unable to do itâ€”for I know, with no freaking doubts, that the feelings I hold are sincere. So please, I'm asking you to give me a chance to prove everything and show you that all my intentions are pure no matter how many times you say it's not.</p>
                  
                  <p>I won't ever force your feelings, just take your time. No matter what your answer may be, I will always carry a smile upon my faceâ€”grateful, for the chance to feel this deeply again. The only thing is that, I want to show you that I am willing to wait whatever your decision might be, just let me, let me stay by your side.</p>
                  
                  <p>As I always say, I can't make promises, but this time I willâ€”I promise you that I am not gonna let you go and I won't leave you in the air as you always expect. Haan ko nga mai-kari nga dika masaktan, ngem mai-karik kenyam nga kaya'k a plastaren iti pagkamalyak tapno diko'n to ulit maaramiden.</p>
                  
                  <p>So once again, let me, even just a little. Pahintulutan mo akong kumatok sa iyong puso, hoping that I can get in, makiki-sawsaw sa iyong buhay, di-uray sangka-bassit man lang ba HAHAHAHAHAH. Maaari mo ba akong bigyan ng awtoridad upang puksain ang iyong mga pangamba at pag-aalala?</p>
                  
                  <p>You are the risk that I am willing to take. There are times when a phrase suddenly comes to mind, sayingâ€”"If I can't take the risk, then I am not worthy of your tinatagong side" HAHAHAHAHAH THAT'S WHYYYY. At that specific night, when I was cornered by your question'sâ€”I was forced to say that I like you ://// I was planning not too (yet), because I was afraid of what will the consequences beâ€”however it was not as I expected HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AND I AM THANKFUL FOR THAT.</p>
                  
                  <p>You are worth every fear I must proudly conquer and every challenges I must endure. I am prepared to risk everything in order to pursuit you, no matter how dangerous each step I take along a path filled with uncertainty.</p>
                  
                  <p>I want to learn more about youâ€”to understand the depths of your thoughts, feelings, the wavy rhythms of your heart, and the stories that shape you the way you are right now. I long to stand and stay beside you when you need someone to be there for you and scream all of your problems, if you can't scream then just say it like you normally doâ€”I will always be all ears. I really do want to witness you show all your emotions like joy, sadness, annoyed, and etc. Let me be that annoying "ngilaw" in your freaking peaceful life that chooses you again-and-again to annoy you (it's not about ngilaw HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH NAM).</p>
                  
                  <p>You deserve more, and that is why I am shaping myself into the person worthy of youâ€”one who can meet your expectations and offer you the respect and love you are worthy of.</p>
                  
                  <p>Ginuhugma tika Frinsezzzzz HAHAHAHAHAHAH ano ang masasabi mo? Pwede po ba akong maging parte ng iyong bohai? Kung ayaw mo mag asawa, edi wag, pake koâ€”bigyan mo lang ako ng pagkakataon na maging istorbo sa bohai mo oki na.</p>
