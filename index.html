                  <h3><p>So this is it,</p></h3>
                  <p>I like you. I definitely like you—it's not just about your presence, I mean all; the soft voice you have (kahit di marinig), the serious look on your face (literall), the way you engage and socialize with people, and lastly the weirdness that you hesitate to show in public—probably one of your attractive side to be honest HAHAHAHAHA kaya nga na-fall ako, I'm attracted to weird and lowkey ahhh people, and it makes me want to protect and ano you yung parang ano ba.</p>
                  
                  <p>I also apologize for liking you, it was accidental and I never planned to because of what you said to me one time na "I felt betrayed if you, my bff, actually have fallen for me." You are just so very attractive—not just the outside ships kase ammo mon, but the weirdness and mixed personality that you possess. I was, and I am still interested in you, I want to know more about you. I'm purposely want to be something that can be part of both your heart and mind. All the unspoken thoughts and emotions I carried when I first began speaking to you have, at last, finally been said, written, and typed na ginawang site.</p>
                  
                  <p>As for the reasoning behind all of this—well, I am a programmer, remember? I once said I longed to create something truly unique… and this is it—a site made for my confession HAHAHAHAHAHH. No other guy did this to you right? Originally, my intention was to put everything into a letter—a longggggg assssss written letter, but then you said that ano, may gumawa na non sayo kaya ayon, meron na akong naisip na ibang paraan HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAH.</p>
                  
                  <p>So yes, every word I spoke was true—I'm seryos asf w/ u, no other words can describe it. I want to commit even if you wont do the same, I want to pursue you for realll, and I am prepared to embrace every risk, even if it means both of us may wound each other. Still, I ask—allow me the honor of courting you, even if it take years as I know that you are not allowed to have a funny thing called ano Gayyem until you have a work.</p>
                  
                  <p>I will wait.</p>
                  
                  <p>"D uray masaktan kanto metlang ud-udi?", wen urayek.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Haan ko pela gamin kaya agi risk, baka nu masaktan nak metla ud-udi", kaya ka nga urayen ingga na nga kayamon, I will always reassure you that I won't do the same mistake and bomb decisions that your past headaches had made.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Baka sao-saom la dagita—baka un-una nalang." haan, I can show you that you're wrong, actions with words are unstoppable.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Bengeg nak" ana't pakek ita.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Narigat nak i handle" ikarigatak nga i handle ka</p>
                  
                  <p>"Dinak maawatan" HAHAHAHAAHAH awaten ka a ana kuma.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Sure ka kenyakon?" sigurado ssob.</p>
                  
                  <p>"Haan nak ibat-bati" maibati ka garud nu aginnuray ta? HAHAHAHAH</p>
                  
                  <p>"Agpapada kayo" HAHAHAHAHAH NO</p>
                  
                  <p>"Aguray ka d uray haan a sigurado?", yes, I'll wait</p>
                  
                  <p>"Baka masaktan ka" hindi HAHAHAHAH I can take all the pain in order to reach you, just don't bugaw-bugaw me with words nga nasa-sakit, I'm a really soft guy pagdating sa mga words na nakakasakit 😓</p>

                  <p>"Baka maistorbo ka" IDC if it's you, you never bothered me.</p>
‎
‎                  
                  <p>"kasta met ibagbaga da HAHAHAAH" do you think I'm them? pati dagita us-usarek nga words of anon ket man-mantsaan da—but I'll change it, kayat konagbalin nga uniq.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                  <p>"Ado da pay dita, makasarak ka mt sabali", ehhhh so what?? Are they "you"? No, not at all. Therefore, I would rather be a Priest if it's not you.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                  <p>Let's not overthink the future too much and focus on building what we are and what we have right now, the present, wag mo po sana pangunahan :((( I believe in what we have right now, and I’m willing to put in the effort to make it grow. </p>
                  
                  <p>I know that you are afraid, afraid of loving someone again, and scared that you might get hurt again. You continue to push me away, yet I find myself unable to do it—for I know, with no freaking doubts, that the feelings I hold are sincere. So please, I'm asking you to give me a chance to prove everything and show you that all my intentions are pure no matter how many times you say it's not.</p>
                  
                  <p>I won't ever force your feelings, just take your time. No matter what your answer may be, I will always carry a smile upon my face—grateful, for the chance to feel this deeply again. The only thing is that, I want to show you that I am willing to wait whatever your decision might be, just let me, let me stay by your side.</p>
                  
                  <p>As I always say, I can't make promises, but this time I will—I promise you that I am not gonna let you go and I won't leave you in the air as you always expect. Haan ko nga mai-kari nga dika masaktan, ngem mai-karik kenyam nga kaya'k a plastaren iti pagkamalyak tapno diko'n to ulit maaramiden.</p>
                  
                  <p>So once again, let me, even just a little. Pahintulutan mo akong kumatok sa iyong puso, hoping that I can get in, makiki-sawsaw sa iyong buhay, di-uray sangka-bassit man lang ba HAHAHAHAHAH. Maaari mo ba akong bigyan ng awtoridad upang puksain ang iyong mga pangamba at pag-aalala?</p>
                  
                  <p>You are the risk that I am willing to take. There are times when a phrase suddenly comes to mind, saying—"If I can't take the risk, then I am not worthy of your tinatagong side" HAHAHAHAHAH THAT'S WHYYYY. At that specific night, when I was cornered by your question's—I was forced to say that I like you ://// I was planning not too (yet), because I was afraid of what will the consequences be—however it was not as I expected HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH AND I AM THANKFUL FOR THAT.</p>

                  <p></p>>
                  
                  <p>You are worth every fear I must proudly conquer and every challenges I must endure. I am prepared to risk everything in order to pursuit you, no matter how dangerous each step I take along a path filled with uncertainty.</p>

                <p>I’ve totally fallen for you. You give me this weird feeling every time I see your name in my notifications, every time you message me, look at me, or even talk to me. Is this what they call butterflies? I don’t know… maybe? I looked it up, and it perfectly describes how I feel. I am sorry, I really do need to apologize, for me, for you, that I liked you. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I get anxious everytime I wonder if I'm treating you right the way you deserve this time? Are you not annoyed with me? Is there something I’m doing that hurts you? That’s why I’m so cautious. If I ever misstep, please tell me.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I really like you, to the point that I am willing to wait for hours, days, months, and even years for you. I stay up all night just so I could talk to you about some weird shts. Even you, telling me how your day went, it excites me if it's about you. I want you to yap at me everytime, I want to listen you all day long. I care about you.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I will give you everything that I could offer you without hesitations in ny head. No pressure—take it only if you want to.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I want to show you that not everyone leaves, through ups and downs, I would stay. I’ll show you my best and my flaws, because I want you to know the real me.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I won't leave. I won't give up—everything I feel is sincere and genuine without any doubts. Push me away, and I would still be there. I mean yes, there are hundreds, thousands, or even millions of reasons to leave—however, you are the very reason I would stay. But I'll always respect your space too.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                <p>I always try my best to be better for you. I am not "them", I am me. </p>
                  
                  <p>I want to learn more about you—to understand the depths of your thoughts, feelings, the wavy rhythms of your heart, and the stories that shape you the way you are right now. I long to stand and stay beside you when you need someone to be there for you and scream all of your problems, if you can't scream then just say it like you normally do—I will always be all ears. I really do want to witness you show all your emotions like joy, sadness, annoyed, and etc. Let me be that annoying "ngilaw" in your freaking peaceful life that chooses you again-and-again to annoy you (it's not about ngilaw HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH NAM).</p>
                
                   <p>You deserve more, and that is why I am shaping myself into the person worthy of you—one who can meet your expectations and offer you the respect and love you are worthy of.</p>
                 
                    <p>I guess we really don’t know what tomorrow holds, but today? I choose you. Not out of habit, not out of loneliness—but because everytime I imagine something special, your in it. So yeah, I am scared of fcking up everything, scared of being not enough—but the most scariest sht that I am afraid of is that never telling you that you're that kind of a human being that I want to risk.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>I won’t lie—this scares me too. I am terrified of what will the consequences might be. Not just the rejection, but the possibility of you leaving w/o any trace. I’m terrified of this, but I’m more terrified of never trying. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>We might hurt each other, misunderstand things, or even fight. But I hope that we could solve and walk through all of this willingly instead of going to sleep with a heavy heart in both of our hearts.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Wag mong aksayahin ang panahon mo matapatan mo lang ang aking enerhiya, do what you want to do, I understand. We have different lives anyway. You don't even need to respond to this. Just letting you know that you are safe with me. </p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Kitam tuy inaramid mo kenyak ಠ⁠︵⁠ಠ, kasla nak la  bagtit nga umis-isem memesa balay, tas naka sango CP—I am not complaining abt that, I'm very happy with it. Kyaaa yessss.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Look, I ain't good with fancy words, but here's the truth—I'm very commited. D uray adda ta man iti bubong, wenno groundfloor, I'll be that idiot ass who won't leave nor  complain about things. Most things in life come with expiration dates, but this? Kakaiba to.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>You are more than enough. No matter what happens, I’ll always cherish what we have.</p>
‎
‎
                    
                    <p>Thank you for letting me feel this way—it’s terrifying and beautiful all at once.</p>
                 
                    <p>Ginuhugma tika Frinsezzzzz HAHAHAHAHAHAH ano ang masasabi mo? Pwede po ba akong maging parte ng iyong bohai? Kung ayaw mo mag asawa, edi wag, pake ko—bigyan mo lang ako ng pagkakataon na maging istorbo sa bohai mo oki na.</p>
